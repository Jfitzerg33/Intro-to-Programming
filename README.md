This repository exists to hold the assignments that I will be creating throughout the rest of my schooling here at Southwest Tech.
My name is James Fitzgerald and I am a student here at Southwest Tech.  I am currently married with no children and work at Domino's as a pizza delivery driver while going to school. I have 3 brothers, 2 sisters, and 2 nephews.  
I am studying software development in order to specialize in either IOS or Android applications.  I have always had a fascination with programming and the language used for it, and learning about it now is an amazing feeling and makes me feel accomplished in life.
